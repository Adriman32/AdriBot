## TODO

* Add function to listen to adricraft-chat for when someone changes the \ or / chain, also occasionally add a new \ or /, maybe on startup
* Add chegg link functionality, rather than having users contribute to chegg account cost, we just leech someone's pre-existing chegg premium account, and just give them a shoutout each time the chegg bot replies
* Add word filter that checks messege for profanity and bot in same msg. Adribot then replies more appropriatly
* Add certain users can update adribot status
